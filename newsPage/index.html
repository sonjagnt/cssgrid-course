              The Scalability Solution: Understanding Layer One vs. Layer Two
              Blockchains

              Layer one or L1 refers to a base blockchain protocol like Bitcoin
              or Ethereum. These networks operate on a decentralized ledger
              secured by

                proof-of-work (PoW) mining or proof-of-stake (PoS) staking </a
              >. L1 chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum offer unparalleled
              security. However, during peak times, both of these chains grapple
              with sluggish transaction speeds and steep fees.
            </p>

            <p>
              Developers from several L1 networks are working to improve layer
              one scaling through methods like

              proof-of-stake consensus. However, substantial layer one upgrades
              require coordination among node operators and can take years to
              implement. Some blockchains intend to use L2 protocols as either a
              temporary or long-term solution.

              (LN) is a second-layer scaling solution designed to facilitate
              faster, low-cost transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain (L1). It
              operates on top of Bitcoin’s base layer, allowing for instant
              payments by circumventing the need for block confirmations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Transactions on the Lightning Network occur off-chain in payment
              channels between users. Only channel open and close transactions
              are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. Participants can transact
              multiple times within these channels, reducing congestion and fees
              on L1.
            </p>

            <p>
              Critics target LN for its prevalent use of custodial wallets, as
              these demand users place trust in third parties to handle their
              money. Moreover, the off-chain method poses a risk: if nodes lack
              proper backup, it could trigger an irrevocable loss of funds.

              Loopring uses zero-knowledge rollups (<a

              >) to batch hundreds of transactions off-chain and generate a
              cryptographic proof verifying their validity. This proof is
              submitted to layer one (Ethereum), avoiding the need to process
              each transaction on-chain.
            </p>

            <p>
              Polygon ZKEVM also uses ZK-rollup technology to offer high
              throughput Ethereum transactions with lower fees. On the risk
              side, some believe that relying heavily on ZK-rollups can
              introduce

              as validators and sequencers become key to the system.
